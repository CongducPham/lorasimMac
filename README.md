Extension of LoRaSim 0.2.1 simulator
====================================

This extension allows for simulation of more complex MAC protocols.

LoRaSimMac v1.0: extension of LoRaSim

- add simple carrier sense with backoff procedure and our proposed collision avoidance mechanism
 									
- can serve as a basis for simulating other MAC protocols for LoRa networks
 
Scientific references to cite if you are using this extension of the simulator:
 
- for the early proposition on the collision avoidance mechanism
